<h1>What a membership is</h1>

<div>Prevents spam - a lot of videos on the internet are dumb as hell. This makes sure only content creators who are serious are uploading videos</div>

<div>Allows fans to subscribe to you - fans can subscribe to your premium content for just 2$ a month. </div>

<div>Allows you to upload videos - what’s a video hosting site without videos</div>

<div>Allows us to cover the cost of hosting - video hosting isn’t cheap. It costs around .02$ per GB of image and video. That doesn’t seem like a lot, but it adds up. A 4 minute video is around 1 GB. If you upload 30 4 minute videos a month it costs 1.80 per month.</div>

  <% if user_signed_in? %>

    <% elsif current_user.merchant.nil? %>
      <%= link_to "Become a merchant", new_user_merchant_path(current_user) %>
